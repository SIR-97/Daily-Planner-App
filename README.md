# Daily-Planner-App

For this challenge I utilised skills learnt about third party APIs to create a daily planner application. This task required me to make use of the following skills:
- DOM manipulation
- Advanced JavaScript
- Integration of third-party APIs 
- jQuery: Moment.js library

My application meets the the following criterior:

- Displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
- Presents timeblocks for standard business hours (9-5pm).
- Color-codes each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
- Allows the user to enter an event when they click on a timeblock.
- Saves the event to a local storage when the save button is clicked each respective timeblock.
